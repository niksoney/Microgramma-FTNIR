## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `/Scripts`: R scripts used for morphometric analysis, spectral processing, and phylogenetic modeling.   
- `/Figures`: Includes only the figures and graphical outputs generated from the analyses described in the manuscript.
- `/Data`: The complete raw and processed datasets will be hosted on OneDrive due to their large file size.

## üìä Data and Figures

The **raw datasets**, **statistical outputs**, and **high-resolution figures** generated in this study are currently under embargo.  
Upon formal publication of the article, **all materials will be made publicly available through a OneDrive link**, which will be provided here once the embargo period ends.

## ‚ú® Analysis Highlights

This study employs a combination of statistical techniques to extract relevant information from the FT-NIR spectra. The main methods include:

-   **Spectral Pre-processing:** Application of `Standard Normal Variate (SNV)` for spectral correction, aiming to reduce noise and eliminate baseline variations in the FT-NIR spectra.
.
-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** For exploring and visualizing natural groupings in the data.
-   **Predictive Modeling:** Use of `Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis` (PLS-DA) to build classification models.
-   **Data Visualization:** Creation of high-quality graphs and figures with the `ggplot2` package.
-   **Leaf Dimorphism:** We tested how NIR data differentiate frond types (fertile and sterile).
