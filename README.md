## ‚ú® Analysis Highlights

This study employs a combination of statistical techniques to extract relevant information from the FT-NIR spectra. The main methods include:

-   **Spectral Pre-processing:** Application of `Standard Normal Variate (SNV)` for spectral correction, aiming to reduce noise and eliminate baseline variations in the FT-NIR spectra.
.
-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** For exploring and visualizing natural groupings in the data.
-   **Predictive Modeling:** Use of `Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis` (PLS-DA) to build classification models.
-   **Data Visualization:** Creation of high-quality graphs and figures with the `ggplot2` package.
-   **Leaf Dimorphism:** We tested how NIR data differentiate frond types (fertile and sterile).
